notes on performance testing tools, techniques, and results

FreeBSD performance monitoring tools
  - iperf

existing work on ipfw performance
  - general freebsd network performance
    - https://wiki.freebsd.org/NetworkPerformanceTuning 

how to test performance
  - need to consider how performance changes with more rules, 
    - different kinds of rules?
    - stateful?
    - dynamic rules?
  - could we use IPFW to test itself?
    - dummynet
