system load will need to be queried so that ipfw can dynamically update the
percentage of packets that it's going to ignore

when
  - I'm thinking that it'll be done on an interval
    - based on time or packet number?
  - doing the check before every packet is not reasonable

where
  - option: have a seperate daemon running that updates a global variable that
    ipfw uses

how
  - there are programs that can already do this for me
