notes on development work, design decisions and resources for working with the
code base
<<<

todo
  - go with daemon approach to start
    - planning to dynamically regenerate rules with new probabilities
    - ipfw show will help here 
    - needs to be a c program

development cycle
  - kldunload ipfw && kldload ipfw
    - firewall rules don't seem to be loaded when ipfw is unloaded and reloaded. 
  - makefile in /sys/modules/ipfw

notes: general
  - IPFW is composed of two parts: a userland utility for controlling firewall
    functionality and a kernel-level packet filter engine. 
    - kernel level packet filtering engine
      - svnweb.freebsd.org/base/head/sys/netpfil/ipfw 
    - userland utility 
      - https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/head/sbin/ipfw/

  - could have daemon that periodically reruns
    - " ipfw add 100 set 1 prob % allow"
    - or set a sysctl value. IPFW already has a lot of sysctl values it works
      with
      - eg: net.inet.ip.*

example ruleset
- first allow,deny ends the search, so having a prob % allow will let us get
  the probabilistic "just match and move on" that we want

  ipfw add 100 set 1 prob 0.5 allow
  ipfw add 101 set 2 deny ip from not 1.2.3.4 to any
