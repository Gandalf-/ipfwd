  - go with daemon approach to start, update a sysctl variable

development cycle
=================
  - kldunload ipfw && kldload ipfw
    - firewall rules don't seem to be loaded when ipfw is unloaded and reloaded. 
  - makefile in /sys/modules/ipfw

general notes
=============
  - IPFW is composed of two parts: a userland utility for controlling firewall
    functionality and a kernel-level packet filter engine. 
    - kernel level packet filtering engine
      - svnweb.freebsd.org/base/head/sys/netpfil/ipfw 
    - userland utility 
      - https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/head/sbin/ipfw/

  - could have daemon that periodically reruns
    - " ipfw add 100 set 1 prob % allow"
    - or set a sysctl value. IPFW already has a lot of sysctl values it works with
      - eg: net.inet.ip.*
