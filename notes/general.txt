considerations:
  - need to consider what to about packet retransmissions, what if we drop a
    packet because it's bad, then it gets' retransmitted

notes: general
  - IPFW is maintined with FreeBSD, it's PF that's from OpenBSD
  - working on FreeBSD 11.0 Release
  - focus is on performance, what the system does with the packets is not in
    the scope of the project
  - hostnames in rules are resolved when they're added
  - the development part might be pretty easy, focus should be on analysis
    - how is this better
    - how is this worse
  - dynamic rules are useful for allowing return traffic after a packet goes
    out from the internal network. Works for UPD and TCP
  - pipes/dummynet can limit bandwidth

  - freebsd network stack parallelization

notes: performance
  - IPFW high performance alternative?
