    implementation "complete", just needs tweaks

  october 15
    hardware ready?

need to consider what to about packet retransmissions, what if we drop a packet
because it's bad, then it gets' retransmitted

notes
  - focus is on performance, what the system does with the packets is not in
    the scope of the project
  - hostnames in rules are resolved when they're added
  - the development part might be pretty easy, focus should be on analysis
    - how is this better
    - how is this worse
  - dynamic rules are useful for allowing return traffic after a packet goes
    out from the internal network. Works for UPD and TCP
  - pipes/dummynet can limit bandwidth

example ruleset
- first allow,deny ends the search, so having a prob % allow will let us get
  the probabilistic "just match and move on" that we want

  ipfw add 100 set 1 prob 0.5 allow
  ipfw add 101 set 2 deny ip from not 1.2.3.4 to any
  ...
