# vim: syntax=markdown:

BSDCan is a presentation based conference, which means that there likely won't
be proceedings resulting from it. (Proceedings are where the papers are
published). This is fine though, since we can still submit the paper to the
graduate committee

Nelson still thinks that the paper is going to be good enough to submit, which
is what we're shooting for. We could also find another conference to submit the
paper to once it's done, even though it's likely to be rejected. It's likely to
be rejected because the project is platform specific and the conferences that
take papers are very competitive.

So, I'll complete the BSDCan submission, which asks for a presentation with
slides. The slides and paper aren't due yet (it's a proposal). Then I'll finish
the paper. If BSDCan accepts the presentation proposal, I'll write the slides
and figure out how to spend an hour on it. Even if BSDCan doesn't accept the
proposal, I can still submit the paper to the graduate committee and that'll
count for my graduation.

It would be nice to have the paper published, but it's not a requirement for
graduation.
